#The Art of the Sell - Jaimee Newberry

- Everyone in this room should consider themselves a salesman
- Two rules of design

> 1. Kill your darlings
> 2. Sell your shit

- "Don't let the customer Frankenstein your three concepts in one, just create one"
- "I don’t do three designs. I listen to them, I design one thing that does what they need, and I sell them on it."
- "Communication is important"
- "Don't "educate" your client. Communicate better to them, bring in clarity and let them understand easily."

>  Trust
>  Confidence
>  Understanding
>  Communication

? "When you have trust, selling is easy"

##Checklist
- Communication design
- Be specific immediately - For productivity in email, be specific immediately: Them “Are you free Friday?” You “I’m free 3-5 (client time zone).”
- Word choices - “I challenge everyone to remove the word ‘just’ from your day-to-day communication.” - "Word choices underscore intentions"
- Speak with confidence
- Don't be a jerk
- Don't be "judgey"
- Accepting responsibility
- Silence will hurt you
- Follow up
- Meet them where they're at
- Love what you do
- Be you!
