#Design Beyond Our Devices - Ethan Marcotte

- What if someone doesn't browse the web like I do?
- Design the priority not the layout
- Support doesn't mean getting the same experience
- A well crafted responsive design is 'Device agnostic'
- Hostile browsers
- Slow networks
- Touch inputs
- Tiny screens
- Emphasize conditions & features, not Devices
- Low bandwidth is not a small device issue
- Device-agnostic design patterns should be as responsive and as resilient as possible
- Building a responsive layout isn't the hard part
- The hard part is documenting and communicating our decisions
