#Extreme Design - Derek Featherstone

- Group closely related things
- We create these standard forms all the time with questions left and answers right
- Consider proximity, pattern of use for low-vision
- Use pattern of use to lead the eye to action
- Use the straw test to find layout and design challenges

- Cannot see a critical vision, how are you going to convey the same message without it
- Think about designing for Dory (that Nemo fish)
- Placeholder should be an existing hint, clone placeholder into label
- People forget things
- How could you improve your interface to make it better for mouse movement in one direction at a time? Drag to one direction
- Focus on the problem not the problem
