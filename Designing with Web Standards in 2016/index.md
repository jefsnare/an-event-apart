#Designing with Web Standards in 2016 - Jeffrey Zeldman

### We have a challenging time
We need to put our work on a lot of different devices, XBOX, Playstation, Android, iOS.
Internet Explorer 6 -> Are you serious??!!

- After the time we've complaining browser support, now we are talking about speed. That 12GB video in the background which is loading on your beautiful responsive site.
- It's a good way to test on slower networks
- No one likes HTML E-mails, it never gets better. If you don't want to learn something, do HTML E-mails
- The Web has moved from HTML E-mails a while ago
- https://24ways.org/2015/grid-flexbox-box-alignment-our-new-system-for-layout
- Now: React.JS -> https://css-tricks.com/the-debate-around-do-we-even-need-css-anymore/
- Then, Bloat: Dreamweaver - Photoshop, Mockup, Development space.. It where awesome times
- Now, Bloat: Bootstrap - It's not the right environment to use on production, this is ideal for prototyping. If we want to write lean, mean, good code. We should write on our own.
- We need to design & code for ourself
- 99.9% of websites are obsolete - The way things where coded they weren't build to last -> '99.9% of Websites are Problematic'
- The perils of browser sniffing - Here you are IE6.css or here you are Opera.css. Newer browsers had different capabilities
- The hidden cost of bloated markup -> Speed is still a problem.
- Blocking users is bad for business -> Progressive enhancement is good for everyone
- One document serves all
- Forward Compatibility Ingredients -> Buy the book Design for Web Standards
- Use valid markup and CSS for layout, use markup for what it means (HTML5)
- Book tip: Adaptive Web Design - Aaron Gustafon (We don't have to exclude people)
- "The web isn't part of our strategy. We're an app-focussed play" <- This is terrible
- "Apps that don't connect to web are dead"
- "Your brand happens between devices"
- "No one wants to download your app when they go to your website"
- "We have a desktop version and a mobile version" - It's based on assumptions and could be responsive. Does it scale? Are your assumptions correct?
- "Never underestimate the power of HTML(5)" - Semantic markup separating content.
- Rethink markup - Use flexbox to further separate markup
- HTML5 -> Custom made for 'Atomic Design'
- "An ID offers a standard meaning for elements in the DOM"
- "Song remains the same"

###Rules for the Road
- Mobile is today's first screen
- Remove distractions
- 90 percent of design is typography, other 90% is whitespace
- Design your system to service tour content, not the other way around
- Style is the servant of brand and content, style without purpose is noise
- Remove each detail from your design until it ... breaks
- Nobody waits => Speed is to today design what ornament was to yesterdays
- Don't design to prove your clever. Make your user thinks they are clever
