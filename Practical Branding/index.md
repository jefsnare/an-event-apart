#Practical Branding - Sarah Parmenter

- 2010 we had visual styles of web designers - far more artistic
- Each design had their own identity, and more personality
- 2006: Jeffrey Zeldman - May day, May day - visual design doesn't matter
- "I don't think were looking at the web as a primary artistic medium at, we could do more of that"
- "Every company is a media company"
- "The amount of knowledge is outrageous"
- "We've been reliable on frameworks", "Buying templates based on Bootstrap"
- "Boring and predictable designs"
- "We keep waiting for permission" - in the old days the web was 'hacky'. Like using images for rounded corners.
- We've actually been stealing UI and UI patterns from the big players like Apple.
- "Design without purpose is noise"
- "Quantity over Quality"
- "Find your authentic story"
- "Get your users to create your content"
- "Create tension by playing with contradictions"

###Rise of progressive enhancement
- "Branding is the product is deliberate conception" - "Branding is not a pattern library or mood board"
- A good pattern library helps

###Research
- Contradictions - Creating attentions in designs is new.
- Facebook audience insights is a great tool for research brands
- "Defining brand language works best when you develop the vocabulary in-house and *then* bring in a copywriter."

###Anatomy of a brand
- Logo mark, color palette, art direction and typefaces

####Logo mark
- Logo mark -> Many people think their logo is their brand
-- "Your logo is not your brand, but simply a foundation and identifier"
- "An icon should be neutral enough" - Shaun Adams
- Spotify, Airbnb and VOX are examples of good redesign
- Airbnb wanted to create a symbol with their redesign
- Airbnb logo parody -> Just Google it.
- "Companies are really afraid to simplify their logo marks"
- "You should be able to draw a good icon in the sand with your toe"

####Color palette
- Color pairing happening a lot - like Spotify
- Pantone 100 postcards - Should buy on Amazon!

###Voice & Tone of your brand
- voiceandtone.com
- Simplify tone and voice

####Social ecosystem
- Publishing channels, follow up channels, support channels, inspirational channels
- "We need to define these channels before out users define them for us"

####Typefaces
- Branding for web designer - A book apart - Ethan Marcotte
- Spotify is using one Typeface
- Fonts in use is a great tool for training your design eye. What typography fits your brand
- Vox is one of the most beautiful news website now

####Layout
- "Tell your story"
- What are the origins of the brand story?
- VOX and Spotify are clearing the grid in design - off grid, using other typography
