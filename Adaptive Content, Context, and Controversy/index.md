#Adaptive Content, Context, and Controversy - Karen McGrane

- I need more than a responsive site, I need adaptive
- Adaptive means *serving* something different
- Responsive is fluid
- Responsive design is Google's recommended approach for building mobile websites
- Conditional loading is a client side technique
- Adjust layout fluidly on the client side
- Prioritize experience
- You can't use device type to predict what users will want
- Most of the time, you're better off serving the same information to all
- Readers donâ€™t want *you* to decide on what content they get on the device they use.
- "display:none; is not a content strategy"
