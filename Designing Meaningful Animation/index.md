##Principles of animation

###Timing & Spacing
- The changes in speed over the duration of the action's timing
- Makes animated object appear to obey the law of physics
- Establishes mood, emotion and reaction
- CSS Easing Keywords
- `cubic-bezier(x1,y1,x2,y2)` -> cubic-bezier.com
- Everything is better with Cubic Bezier

###Follow Trough
- Not everything comes to a stop at once
- Overshooting the target position

###Secondary action
- Supplemental action, refinforces and adds dimension
