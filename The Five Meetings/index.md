####Beginnings
- Meetings that helps us getting started
- Every persona has it's story

> Please remove age gender ethnicity location from personas because they cause assumptions

> Visual listening makes good meetings even better

> Form stronger, deeper memories

- One big visual agenda; represents the *meeting length*
- Actively choose an approach that manages assumptions
- Visualize anything and everything, especially agendas, findings, processes and rough ideas.

####Presentations
> Where we tell the user's story, not the designers

- Book tip: The users journey, Rosenfeld Media
- Presentations are stories, but we learn to give them as real estate tours for some reason
- Presentation stories; beginnings, middles, endings, actions, motivations
- Research a problem and define a solutions
- Consider multiple approaches
- Use good story structure to tell the user's story
- Approach the and any meeting as a design problem

####Middles
- Meetings that keep people moving forward
- Daily team, weekly team, weekly client
- Yesterday, today and blockers are things to notice in Middle meetings
- Lean coffee process -> (boardthing.com) - abstract questions http://leancoffee.org
- Explore distributed approaches even you work in the same office

####Explorations
- 90 minutes, 6 ideas, 6 people
- 6 ideas every 10 minutes, then discuss 10 minutes

####Endings
- Meetings that help us find and learn from closure
- What is the meeting secret sauce of agile process?

> List wins
> List problems
> List changes
> Post and discuss

#####Blameless approach
